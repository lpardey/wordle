Game Rules

    1. Guess the word in 6 tries.
    
    2. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. 

    3. The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
        3.1. Green tile: letter in word / not the right place.
        3.2. Yellow tile: letter in word / in the right place.
        3.3. Grey tile: letter not in word

    4. If the player guess before the 6th try, he can play a new game. This generates a "streak".

    * Games
        The game is always created depending on the player's IP. A new game is created
        every 24 hours since the last game played. If the player ends a current game, he must wait
        24 hours to play a new game. (Other option) A game is created depending on the player's credentials.

    ** Hard Mode
        Hard mode forces you to play any correct letters on subsequent guesses. 
        If you have a green S at the start, you'd have to keep playing S at the start from then on. 
        And if you have a yellow R in the word, all subsequent guesses would have to include R somewhere too.
